- Change: Fixed remaining build-blocking TypeScript/Svelte issues after commit `181faa0` in `src/lib/canvas/CanvasManager.ts`, `src/lib/components/canvas/PageDialog.svelte`, `src/lib/components/UserTable.svelte`, and `src/lib/components/Editor.svelte`.
- Why: Ensure the project compiles cleanly and the previous batch is fully functional for core workflows.
- How to validate:
  - Run `npx svelte-kit sync`.
  - Run `npx svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json` and confirm `0 errors`.
  - Verify PageDialog image upload still works (compressed image assigned correctly).
  - Verify UserTable pagination buttons work with shared Button component.
- Skills used: `skill-creator` (used as execution framework for plan-first, scoped fixes, and explicit traceability/logging).
- History & logs location: `.history/logs/` (this entry records the follow-up completion action).
