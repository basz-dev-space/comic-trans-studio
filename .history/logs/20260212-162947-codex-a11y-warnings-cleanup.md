- Change: Eliminated remaining Svelte warnings by updating label/control semantics in `src/lib/components/canvas/PropertiesPanel.svelte` and fixed the `pageId` captured-initial-state warning in `src/lib/components/Editor.svelte`.
- Why: User requested the project to be completely working/clean; warnings were still present after prior follow-up.
- How to validate:
  - `npx svelte-kit sync`
  - `npx svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json`
  - Confirm output reports `0 errors and 0 warnings`.
- Skills used: `skill-creator` (structured plan execution + minimal targeted edits + traceability).
- History & logs location: `.history/logs/`.
